Design Guide: Replicating the Web Interface Style
General Design Principles
Minimalism: Use only the essential elements. Keep the interface clean, with no unnecessary distractions.
Dark Mode: Use a dark background (#000000 or close) with high-contrast light elements (white or very light gray, #FFFFFF or #F1F1F1).
Modern Aesthetic: Utilize sleek, flat, or slightly rounded UI elements to convey a contemporary and polished look.
Layout and Structure
Grid-based Design:
Use a visible grid for a structured, tech-inspired look.
Align all elements to the grid to maintain visual consistency.
Two-panel Layout:
Left Panel: Tools and customization options (e.g., sliders, buttons, dropdowns).
Right Panel: Interactive 3D product visualization and metadata.
Typography
Font Style: Use a modern sans-serif font such as Roboto, Open Sans, or Inter.
Font Size:
Large, bold headers for titles (e.g., "SELF").
Medium-weight text for subheaders and instructions.
Small, unobtrusive text for additional information or metadata.
Font Colors:
White (#FFFFFF) for primary text on a dark background.
Gray tones (#A0A0A0 to #F0F0F0) for secondary text.
Color Palette
Background:
Primary: Solid black (#000000).
Secondary Elements: Subtle gridlines in dark gray (#1E1E1E).
Highlight Colors:
Use white (#FFFFFF) and subtle accent colors (e.g., red, green, blue, light gray) sparingly.
Interactive Elements:
Sliders, toggles, and buttons should have a hover/active state with subtle color shifts (e.g., from #333333 to #555555).
Interactive Elements
3D Visualization:
Place the 3D object prominently in the center, allowing for full interaction (e.g., rotate, zoom).
Include icons for perspective control (e.g., cube icons for different angles).
Customization Panel:
Sliders: Use sleek, modern sliders with clearly defined endpoints.
Dropdowns/Selectors: Use flat, rounded-corner dropdowns.
Buttons: Minimalist buttons with hover states (e.g., slight increase in brightness or outline).
Content Hierarchy
Main Focus:
The 3D product visualization should be the most prominent element.
Supporting Information:
Show metadata (e.g., dimensions, material) in a clean, unobtrusive card or sidebar on the right.
Call-to-Action (CTA):
Position the “Sign in to save” or similar CTA in a secondary yet noticeable location.
Use a simple button with a hover effect.
Icons and Visual Elements
Icons:
Use modern, flat icons with a geometric design.
Consistent line thickness across all icons.
Product Outline:
Use subtle overlays (e.g., dashed or solid outlines) to enhance the product shape when interacted with.
Sliders:
Include radius-based and linear sliders that adapt to the theme (e.g., dark gray base with white active state).
Animations and Transitions
Subtle Transitions:
Use smooth transitions (200ms-300ms) for hover effects, element visibility, or updates.
Interactive Feedback:
Provide visual feedback for interactions (e.g., button clicks, slider adjustments) with slight animations.
